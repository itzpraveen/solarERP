# Usability & Workflow Evaluation Plan

## 1. User Personas & Device Contexts
- **Office Staff** (Desktop, Tablet)
- **Installer Teams** (Mobile, Tablet)
- **Combined workflows** (handoff between office and field)

## 2. Key Workflows
- **Lead Management:** Capture → qualification → conversion to proposal/customer.
- **Proposal Creation:** Define system specs, calculate incentives, ROI, pricing.
- **Customer Management → Project Initiation:** Onboarding, details capture.
- **Project Tracking:** Timelines, finances, team assignments.
- **Equipment & Inventory:** Stock levels, alerts, compatibility.
- **Service Requests:** Request creation, assignment, resolution.
- **Document Management:** Upload, version tracking, secure sharing.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Pipeline metrics, conversion rates, financial reports.

## 3. UI Structure & Responsiveness
- **MainLayout & Sidebar:** Drawer behavior, breakpoints (`sm`, `md`), collapse/expand.
- **Page Layouts:** Form layouts (Grid), DataTables (column stacking), Typography.
- **Navigation Patterns:** Menu collapse, routing in small screens.
- **Component Usage:** MUI `useMediaQuery`, `Grid`, `Fade`, `Dialog`.

## 4. Device-specific Walkthroughs
### Desktop
- Full‑feature view with multi‑column tables and dialogs.
- Bulk actions, detailed dashboards.

### Tablet
- Adaptive grid layouts, touch‑friendly targets.
- Collapsible panels for reduced space.

### Mobile
- Single‑column flows, simplified forms.
- Prominent call‑to‑action buttons.

## 5. Usability Gaps & Bottlenecks
- Overcrowded tables on narrow screens.
- Dialog‑based forms may require additional scrolling.
- Dropdowns and datepickers larger for touch screens.
- Lack of offline support or PWA capabilities.
- Manual data entry burdens under field conditions.

## 6. Findings & Recommendations
- **Strengths:** Consistent styling, comprehensive domain calculations, JWT security.
- **Improvements:** 
  - Implement responsive, virtualized tables.
  - Enhance mobile PWA/offline support.
  - Add GPS/photo capture in service requests.
  - Optimize dialog layouts for small screens.
- **Roadmap:** Prioritize mobile/tablet enhancements first, then desktop refinements.
