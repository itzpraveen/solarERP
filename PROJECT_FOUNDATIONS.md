Generated: 2025-08-20

## 1. PROJECT DEFINITION

### 1.1 Problem One-Pager

**Problem Statement:**
Solar installation businesses struggle with fragmented operational tools, leading to inefficient project management, poor customer tracking, lost leads, and manual paperwork that reduces profitability and customer satisfaction.

**Who Experiences This:**
- Small to medium solar installation companies (5-50 employees)
- Solar sales teams managing 20+ leads monthly
- Project managers coordinating multiple installations
- Finance teams tracking payments and ROI calculations

**Impact:**
- 30% of leads lost due to poor follow-up
- 15-20% project delays from miscommunication
- 8-10 hours/week spent on manual documentation
- $50K-200K annual revenue loss from inefficiencies

**Success Metrics:**
- Lead-to-customer conversion rate increases by 25%
- Project completion time reduced by 20%
- Document processing time reduced by 75%
- Customer satisfaction score > 4.5/5.0
- System adoption rate > 90% within 60 days

**Non-Goals (Out of Scope):**
- Manufacturing management
- Supply chain logistics beyond inventory
- Multi-company/franchise management
- Solar farm/utility-scale projects
- Integration with government subsidy systems (Phase 2)

### 1.2 Vision Statement
Create the industry's most intuitive and comprehensive ERP system specifically designed for solar installation businesses, enabling them to scale operations efficiently while maintaining exceptional customer service.

## 2. ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD (ADR-000)

### Title: Foundational Architecture Decisions for SolarERP

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Decision Makers:** Technical Architecture Team

### Context
Building a production-ready ERP system for solar installation businesses requiring high reliability, security, and scalability while maintaining development velocity.

### Decisions Made

#### 2.1 Database: PostgreSQL over MongoDB
**Decision:** Migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL  
**Rationale:**
- Strong ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Better support for complex relationships (projects-customers-documents)
- Superior reporting capabilities with SQL
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Better performance for analytical queries

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Loss of schema flexibility (mitigated by JSONB columns where needed)
- More complex horizontal scaling (acceptable for target market size)

#### 2.2 API Architecture: RESTful with Potential GraphQL Layer
**Decision:** REST API with resource-based endpoints  
**Rationale:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Well-supported by tools and libraries
- Sufficient for current requirements
- Easy to cache and optimize

**Future Consideration:** Add GraphQL layer for mobile app (Phase 2)

#### 2.3 Authentication: JWT with Refresh Tokens
**Decision:** Stateless JWT authentication with refresh token rotation  
**Rationale:**
- Scalable across multiple servers
- No server-side session storage required
- Industry standard for SPAs
- Supports mobile apps (future)

**Security Measures:**
- 15-minute access token expiry
- 7-day refresh token with rotation
- Secure httpOnly cookies for web
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

#### 2.4 Frontend Framework: React with TypeScript
**Decision:** Continue with React 19 + TypeScript + Material-UI  
**Rationale:**
- Large ecosystem and community
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- Material-UI provides consistent design system
- Team familiarity

#### 2.5 Deployment Strategy: Container-Based with Cloud Flexibility
**Decision:** Docker containers deployable to multiple platforms  
**Rationale:**
- Platform independence
- Consistent dev/staging/prod environments
- Easy scaling
- Supports both cloud and on-premise

**Supported Platforms:**
- Railway (primary cloud)
- AWS/GCP/Azure (enterprise)
- On-premise Docker (regulated environments)

// Function naming: camelCase, verb prefixes (get, set, create, update, delete)

// Always use explicit types in TypeScript
interface UserData {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
}

// Prefer functional components with hooks
// Use proper error boundaries
// Implement proper loading and error states
```

#### Database Standards
```sql
-- Table naming: plural, snake_case (users, project_documents)
-- Column naming: snake_case (created_at, customer_id)
-- Always use UUIDs for primary keys
-- Include created_at, updated_at timestamps
-- Use ENUM for status fields
-- Index all foreign keys
```

### 9.2 Git Workflow
- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `bugfix/description`, `hotfix/description`
- Commit messages: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:)
- PR required for main branch
- Minimum 1 reviewer approval
- CI must pass before merge

### 9.3 API Standards
- RESTful resource naming
- Consistent error response format
- Pagination on all list endpoints

- Implement archival strategy for old data

3. **Performance Optimizations**
- Implement database connection pooling
- Use prepared statements
- Implement query result caching
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE

## 12. API DESIGN STANDARDS

### RESTful Conventions
```
GET    /api/v1/resources        - List (paginated)
GET    /api/v1/resources/:id    - Retrieve
POST   /api/v1/resources        - Create
PUT    /api/v1/resources/:id    - Full update
PATCH  /api/v1/resources/:id    - Partial update
DELETE /api/v1/resources/:id    - Delete
```

### Response Format Standards
```json
// Success Response
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { },
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 100
  }
}

// Error Response
