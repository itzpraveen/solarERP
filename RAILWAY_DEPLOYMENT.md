4. Start the application: `npm run railway:start`

### 5.2 Manual Deployment (CLI)

```bash
# Deploy current code
railway up

# Deploy with specific environment
railway up --environment production

# View deployment logs
railway logs
```

## Step 6: Database Setup

### 6.1 Run Migrations

Railway should automatically run migrations, but you can manually run them:

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway run npm run db:migrate

# Or in Railway Dashboard
# Navigate to your service â†’ "Settings" â†’ "Deploy" â†’ "Run Command"
# Enter: npm run db:migrate
```

### 6.2 Create Admin User

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway run npm run create-admin

# This uses the ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD from environment variables
```

### 6.3 Seed Data (Optional)

```bash
railway run npm run db:seed
```

## Step 7: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

### 7.1 In Railway Dashboard

1. Go to your service â†’ "Settings" â†’ "Domains"

railway run node -e "
  const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');
  const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  sequelize.authenticate()
    .then(() => console.log('Connected'))
    .catch(err => console.error('Failed:', err));
"
```

#### Issue 3: Application Crashes
```bash
# Check error logs
railway logs --filter error

# Common fixes:
# 1. Verify all environment variables are set
# 2. Check JWT_SECRET is at least 32 characters
# 3. Ensure migrations have run
# 4. Verify Node version matches local development
```

#### Issue 4: Redis Connection Failed
```bash
# Verify REDIS_URL
railway variables | grep REDIS

# Test Redis connection
railway run node -e "
  const redis = require('ioredis');
  const client = new redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
  client.ping().then(() => {
    console.log('Redis connected');
    client.quit();
  });
"
```

## Step 11: Backup Configuration

### 11.1 Enable Automatic Backups

Railway automatically backs up PostgreSQL databases. To configure:
1. Dashboard â†’ PostgreSQL Service â†’ "Settings"
2. Enable "Point-in-time Recovery"
3. Set backup retention period

### 11.2 Manual Backup

```bash
# Create manual backup
railway run pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Download backup locally
railway run pg_dump $DATABASE_URL | gzip > solarerp_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
```

## Step 12: Scaling & Performance

### 12.1 Horizontal Scaling

In Railway Dashboard:
1. Service â†’ "Settings" â†’ "Scaling"
2. Increase "Replicas" count
3. Railway automatically load balances

### 12.2 Vertical Scaling
