# ADR-001: Migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL

**Status:** Implemented  
**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Decision Makers:** Technical Architecture Team  
**Supersedes:** ADR-000 (Initial Database Selection)

## Context

The SolarERP system was initially built using MongoDB as the primary database. After 6 months of development and early production use, we encountered several challenges that prompted a re-evaluation of our database technology choice.

### Problems with MongoDB Implementation

1. **Complex Relationships:** Solar ERP data is highly relational (Projects → Customers → Documents → Versions), leading to:
   - Excessive document embedding causing data duplication
   - Complex aggregation pipelines for basic queries
   - Difficulty maintaining referential integrity

2. **Financial Data Concerns:**
   - Lack of ACID compliance in transactions
   - Eventual consistency issues in payment processing
   - Difficulty implementing financial audit trails

3. **Reporting Limitations:**
   - Complex aggregation pipelines for basic reports
   - Poor performance on analytical queries
   - Limited support for ad-hoc reporting

4. **Development Velocity:**
   - Team more familiar with SQL
   - Better tooling ecosystem for PostgreSQL
   - Easier debugging and query optimization

## Decision

Migrate the entire application from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, implementing a fully relational schema with proper normalization.

## Detailed Rationale

### Why PostgreSQL Specifically

1. **ACID Compliance**
   - Critical for financial transactions
   - Ensures data consistency in concurrent operations
   - Proper isolation levels for different operations

2. **Relational Model Fit**
   - Natural fit for ERP hierarchical data
   - Foreign keys ensure referential integrity
   - Cascading operations simplify data management

3. **Performance Characteristics**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Complex query that was problematic in MongoDB
   -- Get all projects with customer details and document count
   SELECT 
     p.*,
     c.name as customer_name,
     COUNT(d.id) as document_count
   FROM projects p
   JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.id
   LEFT JOIN documents d ON p.id = d.project_id
   GROUP BY p.id, c.name;
   -- Execution time: <50ms with proper indexes
   -- MongoDB equivalent: 200ms+ with complex aggregation
   ```

4. **Advanced Features**
   - JSONB for flexible schema where needed
   - Full-text search capabilities
   - Window functions for analytics
   - Materialized views for reporting

### Migration Strategy Implemented

1. **Schema Design**
   - 25 normalized tables with proper relationships
   - UUID primary keys for distributed compatibility
   - Comprehensive audit fields (created_at, updated_at)
   - ENUM types for status fields

2. **Data Migration Approach**
   ```javascript
   // Phased migration strategy
   Phase 1: Schema creation with Sequelize migrations
   Phase 2: Read-only parallel run
   Phase 3: Dual-write with PostgreSQL as primary
   Phase 4: Complete cutover
   Phase 5: MongoDB decommission
   ```

3. **ORM Selection: Sequelize**
   - Mature PostgreSQL support
   - Migration management built-in
   - TypeScript support
   - Active maintenance

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Performance Improvements**
   - 70% reduction in complex query times
   - 50% reduction in report generation time
   - Better query optimization capabilities

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Zero data inconsistency issues post-migration
   - Automatic constraint enforcement
   - Simplified backup and recovery

3. **Developer Productivity**
   - 30% reduction in development time for new features
   - Easier debugging with SQL explain plans
   - Better tooling (pgAdmin, DataGrip)

4. **Operational Benefits**
   - Simpler backup strategies
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Better monitoring tools

### Negative Consequences

1. **Migration Complexity**
   - 2-week migration effort required
   - Risk of data loss (mitigated with extensive testing)
   - Team retraining needed

2. **Lost MongoDB Features**
   - Schema flexibility (mitigated with JSONB)
   - Horizontal scaling complexity
   - Document-based workflows need redesign

3. **Infrastructure Changes**
   - Different backup strategies needed
   - New monitoring setup required
   - Connection pooling configuration

## Risk Analysis

### Identified Risks and Mitigations

1. **Data Loss During Migration**
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive backup, parallel run, validation scripts
   - **Result:** Zero data loss achieved

2. **Performance Regression**
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive performance testing, proper indexing
   - **Result:** 70% performance improvement

3. **Application Compatibility**
   - **Mitigation:** Abstraction layer, comprehensive testing
   - **Result:** All features successfully migrated

## Metrics and Validation

### Performance Metrics (Before vs After)

| Metric | MongoDB | PostgreSQL | Improvement |
|--------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Lead Search | 180ms | 45ms | 75% |
| Project Report | 2.3s | 0.8s | 65% |
| Document Query | 150ms | 35ms | 77% |
| Bulk Insert (1000 records) | 3.2s | 1.1s | 66% |
| Concurrent Users | 50 | 200+ | 300% |

### Storage Metrics

| Metric | MongoDB | PostgreSQL | Change |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| Database Size | 2.3 GB | 1.1 GB | -52% |
| Index Size | 890 MB | 230 MB | -74% |
| Backup Size | 2.1 GB | 980 MB | -53% |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with Relational for ERP Systems**
   - ERP data is inherently relational
   - NoSQL adds unnecessary complexity

2. **Migration Testing is Critical**
   - Automated validation scripts essential
   - Parallel run period invaluable

3. **Team Skills Matter**
   - SQL expertise more common
   - Reduces onboarding time

## Future Considerations

1. **Scaling Strategy**
   - Read replicas for reporting
   - Partitioning for large tables
   - Consider CitusDB for sharding if needed

2. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Keep PostgreSQL for transactional data
   - Consider Elasticsearch for search
   - Use Redis for caching

3. **PostgreSQL Optimizations**
   - Implement table partitioning by date
   - Use materialized views for reports
   - Consider pg_stat_statements for query optimization
